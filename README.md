# TASK_MANAGER

###  Task Manager is a simple and clean web app that helps you organize your daily tasks.
### You can add new tasks, mark them as complete, or delete them anytime. 
### The app allows you to filter tasks by All, Pending, or Completed. 
### You can also sort the tasks by Newest or Oldest. Everything you add is saved in your browser using localStorage, so your tasks won’t disappear when you refresh. 
### The design is minimal and user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to use.
### It’s fully built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks.

### I have also attached the live link below to try it instantly.
